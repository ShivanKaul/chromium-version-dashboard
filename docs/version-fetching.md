# How each version is fetched

## Live fetchers

Chromium versions for these browsers are fetched live on page load:

### Chrome Stable

Calls `chromiumdash.appspot.com/fetch_releases` for the latest macOS stable release. The JSON response includes the full version and milestone directly.

### Brave Release

Fetches `versions.brave.com/latest/brave-versions.json`, finds the first entry with `channel === "release"`, and reads `dependencies.chrome` for the Chromium version.

### Edge Stable

Calls `edgeupdates.microsoft.com/api/products`, filters for the "Stable" product and a macOS release.

### Perplexity Comet

Queries Comet's Omaha update API at `perplexity.ai/rest/browser/update2` for Windows. This is the same protocol Comet's built-in updater uses to check for new versions. 

### Arc

Fetches the Sparkle appcast at `releases.arc.net/updates.xml`. Arc is in maintenance mode (Chromium security patches only), so every release description contains the full Chromium version.

## CI-detected versions

Chromium versions for these are extracted from local binaries. The CI is run daily via GitHub Actions via the [`update-versions.js`](https://github.com/ShivanKaul/chromium-drift/blob/main/.github/update-versions.js) script and the results are stored in `ci-versions.json`:

### Vivaldi Stable

Downloads the Vivaldi Linux .deb package, extracts the `vivaldi-bin` binary, and uses `strings` to find the embedded Chromium version.

### Opera Stable

Downloads the Opera Linux .deb package, extracts the `opera` binary, and uses `strings` to find the embedded `Chrome/X.X.X.X` UA string.

### ChatGPT Atlas

Fetches the Sparkle appcast to find the latest DMG URL, downloads the DMG, extracts the inner Chromium app's `Info.plist` using 7z, and reads `CFBundleShortVersionString`.

### Dia

Fetches the Sparkle appcast at `releases.diabrowser.com/BoostBrowser-updates.xml` to find the latest ZIP URL, downloads the macOS ZIP, extracts the app binary using 7z, and runs `strings` to find the embedded `Chrome/X.X.X.X` UA string.

### Wavebox

Downloads the Wavebox Linux .deb package from `download.wavebox.app`, extracts the `wavebox` binary, and uses `strings` to find the embedded `Chrome/X.X.X.X` UA string.
