# Chromium Version Dashboard

A dashboard that shows which Chromium version each major browser is currently shipping. Chrome Stable is used as the baseline; other browsers are color-coded by how many major versions behind they are. >=1 version behind lists up as a warning.

Hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

## Tracked browsers

| Browser | Precision | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Chrome Stable (baseline) | Full version | ChromiumDash API |
| Brave Release | Full version | versions.brave.com |
| Vivaldi Release | Full version | Sparkle appcast + release notes |
| Edge | Major only | Microsoft Edge Updates API |
| Opera | Full version | Opera Desktop blog scraping |
| Perplexity Comet | Major only | Uptodown.com version string |

### How each version is fetched

**Chrome Stable**: Calls `chromiumdash.appspot.com/fetch_releases` for the latest macOS stable release. The JSON response includes the full version and milestone directly.

**Brave Release**: Fetches `versions.brave.com/latest/brave-versions.json`, finds the first entry with `channel === "release"`, and reads `dependencies.chrome` for the Chromium version.

**Vivaldi Release**: Two-step. First fetches the Sparkle appcast XML at `update.vivaldi.com` to get the release notes URL. Then fetches that HTML page and regex-matches the Chromium version string (e.g., "[Chromium] Updated to 146.0.7680.211").

**Edge**: Calls `edgeupdates.microsoft.com/api/products`, filters for the "Stable" product and a macOS release.

**Opera**: Two-step, similar to Vivaldi. First fetches the Opera Desktop blog listing at `blogs.opera.com/desktop/` to find the latest major stable release post. Then fetches that post and regex-matches the Chromium version string (e.g., "based on the Chromium version: 146.0.7680.178").

**Perplexity Comet**: Fetches Uptodown's download page for Comet. Comet's version string uses the Chromium major as its first component (e.g., `145.2.7632.5936` = Chromium 145). No first-party API exists.

## How it works

`index.html` is a static page that calls `/api` on load. `/api` is a Cloudflare Pages Function (`functions/api.js`) that fetches version data from each browser's public endpoint in parallel and returns JSON.

Responses are cached at the Cloudflare edge for 30 minutes (`s-maxage=1800`) and in the browser for 5 minutes (`max-age=300`). The "Refresh" button appends a cache-busting query parameter.
