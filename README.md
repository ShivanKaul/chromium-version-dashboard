# Chromium Version Dashboard

A dashboard that shows which Chromium version each major browser is currently shipping. Chrome Stable is used as the baseline; other browsers are color-coded by how many major versions behind they are. >=1 version behind lists up as a warning.

Hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

## Tracked browsers

| Browser | Precision | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Chrome Stable (baseline) | Full version | ChromiumDash API (live) |
| Brave Release | Full version | versions.brave.com (live) |
| Edge | Full version | Microsoft Edge Updates API (live) |
| Vivaldi Release | Full version | Linux .deb binary via CI |
| Opera | Full version | Linux .deb binary via CI |
| ChatGPT Atlas | Full version | macOS DMG plist via CI |
| Perplexity Comet | Major only | uptodown.com (live) |

### How each version is fetched

#### Live fetchers (run at request time in the Cloudflare Pages Function)

**Chrome Stable**: Calls `chromiumdash.appspot.com/fetch_releases` for the latest macOS stable release. The JSON response includes the full version and milestone directly.

**Brave Release**: Fetches `versions.brave.com/latest/brave-versions.json`, finds the first entry with `channel === "release"`, and reads `dependencies.chrome` for the Chromium version.

**Edge**: Calls `edgeupdates.microsoft.com/api/products`, filters for the "Stable" product and a macOS release.

**Perplexity Comet**: Fetches Uptodown's download page for Comet. Comet's version string uses the Chromium major as its first component (e.g., `145.2.7632.5936` = Chromium 145). No first-party API exists.

#### CI-detected versions (run daily via GitHub Actions, results stored in `ci-versions.json`):

**Vivaldi Release**: Downloads the Vivaldi Linux .deb package, extracts the `vivaldi-bin` binary, and uses `strings` to find the embedded Chromium version. Vivaldi overrides the `Chrome/` UA string with its own version, so a broad search filters for Chromium-plausible version patterns (major >= 100, third component > 1000).

**Opera**: Downloads the Opera Linux .deb package, extracts the `opera` binary, and uses `strings` to find the embedded `Chrome/X.X.X.X` UA string.

**ChatGPT Atlas**: Fetches the Sparkle appcast to find the latest DMG URL, downloads the DMG, extracts the inner Chromium app's `Info.plist` using 7z, and reads `CFBundleShortVersionString`. ChatGPT Atlas is macOS-only, so the plist extraction runs on Linux CI without needing a macOS runner.

## How it works

`index.html` is a static page that calls `/api` on load. `/api` is a Cloudflare Pages Function (`functions/api.js`) that returns version data as NDJSON. Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Comet are fetched live from public APIs. Vivaldi, Opera, and ChatGPT Atlas are read from `ci-versions.json`, which is updated daily by GitHub Actions. Manual overrides in `manual-versions.json` take priority over both.

### Version data priority

For live-fetched browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave): manual override > live API fetcher.

For CI-detected browsers (Vivaldi, Opera, Comet, ChatGPT Atlas): manual override > CI version.

### CI automation

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/update-versions.yml`) runs daily at 08:00 UTC. It downloads browser binaries, extracts the Chromium version using `strings` (for .deb packages) or plist extraction (for ChatGPT Atlas DMG), writes the results to `ci-versions.json`, and commits if anything changed. Can also be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`.
